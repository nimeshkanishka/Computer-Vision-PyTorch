# Doodle Classifier

A simple doodle classifier inspired by [Sebastian Lague's YouTube video titled "How to Create a Neural Network (and Train it to Identify Doodles)"](https://youtu.be/hfMk-kjRv4c?t=2905). The PyTorch model is trained on 10 selected classes from the Quick, Draw! dataset. When the user draws on the canvas, the model predicts what it is in real-time.

# Datasets
