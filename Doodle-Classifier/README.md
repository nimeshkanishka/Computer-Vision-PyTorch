# Doodle Classifier

A simple doodle classifier inspired by [Sebastian Lague's YouTube video titled "How to Create a Neural Network (and Train it to Identify Doodles)"](https://youtu.be/hfMk-kjRv4c?t=2905). The PyTorch model is trained on 10 selected categories from the Quick, Draw! dataset. When the user draws on the canvas, the model predicts what it is in real-time.

# Datasets

[Quick, Draw! Dataset](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset): The entire Quick, Draw! dataset consisting of 50 million drawings across 345 categories.

[Dataset I used for training](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jhunbrianandam/quickdraw10-dataset): A small subset of Quick, Draw! dataset consisting of 30k drawings from 10 categories (3k drawings per category).
